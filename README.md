# Cooked_To_Location

This is project created by Chenlu Ji, Jiayi Wang and Sam Park for Big Data Analytics.

In this project, we aim to do three things. Firstly, predict the location of a restaurant type based off the description of the restaurant, which would yield success of that restaurant. Secondly, based off the location, predict the type of restaurant that would yield to the success of the restaurant. And lastly, based off the location and restaurant type, predict the yelp rating. For recommendation, we utilized SQLite for database and queries of different conditions. For rating classification, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree and Tree Ensemble models are implemented.
